 This extension allows Retrospectiva users to update tickets via 
 SCM log messages.
 
 Usage
 =====
 
 When you commit changes to your repository, you can automatically
 update Retrospectiva tickets by using a special syntax in your commit
 log message.
 
 The 'user', 'status', 'priority' and 'milestone' attributes can be set.
 Multiple formats are supported. Examples:

   [#1234](status:fixed user:mabs) Fixed a little Bug
   
   [#1234] Fixed a little Bug (status:fixed priority:high)

   Fixed a little Bug [#1234](status:assigned milestone:upcoming)
 
 Attribute value with spaces must be put it in double quotes:

   [#1234](status:fixed milestone:"0.9.x (pre-alpha)") Fixed Bug

 Multiple tickets can be updated at the same time.

   [#1234](status:fixed user:dim priority:low) Fixed one problem
   [#5678](status:fixed user:dim) Fixed another problem
